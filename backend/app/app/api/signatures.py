# HTTP Message Signatures

Given the federated nature of ActivityPub servers, it is critical that any requests received are from who they say they are.

Enter [HTTP Message Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421). What follows leans heavily on schemes
developed by:

    - [Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/), which has great documentation
    - Bovine's [Cattle Grid](https://bovine.codeberg.page/cattle_grid/) and its further implementation in
    [Bovine Herd](https://bovine-herd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/.)
    - [TakahÄ“](https://github.com/jointakahe/takahe)

Because of the nature of the process, it's difficult to use anything off-the-shelf. A combination of web proxying,
database and web framework stack all make things somewhat fiddly.

The process is structured as followed:

1. Verify HTTP Signatures:
    - A wrapper around `APIRouter` requests
    - Tests the HTTP Signature
    - Checks if the requester is on the main server blocklist.
2. Inbox POST validation:
    - A similar check, but for the actor activity ... this requires the targetted actor to respond to the requesting
    actor, and - for their safety - this requires the other checks happen in advance.
    - An additional check as to whether the actor has blocked the requester.

Mastodon describes the special use-case for Linked Data signatures for actor deletion notices, since the actor is no
longer reachable (i.e. no public key).

## What is it?

This FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Neo4j & Nuxt 3 repo will generate a complete web application stack as a foundation for your project development.

It consists of the following key components:

- **Docker Compose** integration and optimization for local development.
- **Authentication** user management schemas, models, crud and apis already built, with OAuth2 JWT token support & default hashing. Offers _magic link_ authentication, with password fallback, with cookie management, including `access` and `refresh` tokens.
- [**FastAPI**](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) backend with [Inboard](https://inboard.bws.bio/) one-repo Docker images, using Python 3.11:
  - **SQLAlchemy** version 2.0 support for models.
  - **Pydantic** version 2.7 for schemas.
  - **Metadata Schema** based on [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-3) for inheritance.
  - **Common CRUD** support via generic inheritance.
  - **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) and [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).
  - **MJML** templates for common email transactions.
  - [**Many other features**]("https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/"): including automatic validation, serialization, interactive documentation, etc.
- [**Nuxt/Vue 3**](https://nuxt.com/) frontend using TypeScript:
  - **Authorisation** via middleware for page access, including logged in or superuser.
  - **Model blog** project, with [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for writing Markdown pages.
  - **Form validation** with [Vee-Validate 4](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/).
  - **State management** with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), and persistance with [Pinia PersistedState](https://prazdevs.github.io/pinia-plugin-persistedstate/).
  - **CSS and templates** with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/), and [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/).
- **PostgreSQL** database.
- **PGAdmin** for PostgreSQL database management.
- **Celery** worker that can import and use models and code from the rest of the backend selectively.
- **Flower** for Celery jobs monitoring.
- **Neo4j** graph database, including integration into the FastAPI base project.
- Load balancing between frontend and backend with **Traefik**, so you can have both under the same domain, separated by path, but served by different containers.
- Traefik integration, including Let's Encrypt **HTTPS** certificates automatic generation.

## Who is it for?

This project is a rock-solid foundation on which to build complex web applications which need parallel processing, scheduled event management, and a range of relational and graph database support. The base deployment - with PostgreSQL and Neo4j - takes up about 10Gb, and requires about 2Gb of memory to run. 

This is **not** a light-weight system to deploy a blog or simple content-management-system.

It is for developers looking to build and maintain full feature progressive web applications that can run online, or offline, want the complex-but-routine aspects of auth 'n auth, and component and deployment configuration taken care of.

## How to use it

### Installing for local development

Running Cookiecutter to customise the deployment with your settings, and then building with Docker compose, takes about 20 minutes.

- [Development and installation](development-guide.md)

### Deploying for production

This stack can be adjusted and used with several deployment options that are compatible with Docker Compose, but it is designed to be used in a cluster controlled with pure Docker in Swarm Mode with a Traefik main load balancer proxy handling automatic HTTPS certificates, using the ideas from [DockerSwarm.rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks).

- [Deployment for production](deployment-guide.md)

### Authentication with magic and TOTP

Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication extends the login process to include a challenge-response component where the user needs to enter a time-based token after their preferred login method.

- [Authentication and magic tokens](authentication-guide.md)

### More details

After using this generator, your new project will contain an extensive `README.md` with instructions for development, deployment, etc. You can pre-read [the project `README.md` template here too](../{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/README.md).

## Release Notes

See notes and [releases](https://github.com/whythawk/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql/releases). The last four release notes are listed here:

## 0.9.0

Updates to `backend`:
- FastAPI 0.99 -> 0.109 (Inboard 0.51 -> 0.68)
- Pydantic 1.10 -> 2.7.1

Updates to `frontend`:
- NuxtJS 3.6.5 -> 3.11.2
- Nuxtjs i18n 8.0.0 RC -> 8.3.1

The Pydantic change is dramatic, so please revise their [migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.7/migration/). Similarly, [nuxt/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/docs/getting-started) has some major quality of life improvements.

## 0.8.2

Fixing [#39](https://github.com/whythawk/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql/issues/39), thanks to @a-vorobyoff:

- Exposing port 24678 for Vite on frontend in development mode.
- Ensuring Nuxt content on /api/_content doesn't interfere with backend /api/v routes.
- Checking for password before hashing on user creation.
- Updating generated README for Hatch (after Poetry deprecation).
- Minor fixes.

### 0.8.1

- Minor updates to Docker scripts for `build`.

### 0.8.0

  - `@nuxtjs/i18n` for internationalisation, along with language selection component.
  - `@vite-pwa/nuxt` along with button components for install and refreshing the app and service workers, and a CLI icon generator.
